##🌫️ Air-Quality-Dataset-Analysis-EDA
🚀 Challenge of the Month Project
This project involves a comprehensive exploratory data analysis and visualisation of an air quality dataset. The primary aim is to uncover meaningful patterns and relationships that can provide insights into air pollution trends and sensor data behaviour.

📝 Dataset Description
The dataset comprises 9,358 hourly records collected using 5 metal oxide chemical sensors integrated into an air quality monitoring device. This device was deployed at roadside level in a highly polluted area of an Italian city.

Data was captured from March 2004 to February 2005, making this one of the most extensive publicly available datasets from field-deployed air quality sensors.

It includes hourly averaged values of:

CO (Carbon Monoxide)

NMHC (Non-Methane Hydrocarbons)

Benzene

NOx (Nitrogen Oxides)

NO₂ (Nitrogen Dioxide)

These values were validated using reference analyzers co-located at the measurement site.
